/// Q1: Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.
/// Example:
/// Given nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1], nums2 = [2, 2], return [2].
/// Note:
/// - Each element in the result must be unique.
/// - The result can be in any order.
/// Solution: Basic concept is to create two sets to store unique elements and then use intersection method of Hashset to extract unique common elements.
